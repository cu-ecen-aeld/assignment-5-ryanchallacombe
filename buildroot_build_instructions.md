### Buildroot build instructions: based on Assignment 4 part 2 and assignment 5 part 2

## Setup
setup actions runner
used instructions here for secret key setup https://github.com/cu-ecen-aeld/aesd-assignments/wiki/Setting-up-Github-Actions

Perform any needed cloning/merging/pulling from git

# Add buildroot as a submodule

`git submodule add https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot/`

`cd buildroot/`

`git checkout 2024.02.x`
	Branch '2024.02.x' set up to track remote branch '2024.02.x' from 'origin'.
	Switched to a new branch '2024.02.x

- Can confirm the branch is correct by looking at the CHANGES file to confirm it is from 2024
`more CHANGES`


- verify that it is there
`cat .gitmodules
[submodule "assignment-autotest"]
	path = assignment-autotest
	url = https://github.com/cu-ecen-5013/assignment-autotest
[submodule "buildroot"]
	path = buildroot
	url = https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot/ `

 I sepnt a lot of time trying to figure out the next step, but the post below was helpful 
 Lots of info here in the
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1777854/how-can-i-specify-a-branch-tag-when-adding-a-git-submodule

`git add buildroot/ `

`git commit -m "added buildroot submodule with branch 2024.02.x" `

`git push`

## Create any needed files for your buildroot module
In assingment 4 we did the following
- created 3 files in base_external dir. Pasted all contents directly from the hello_world example provided in lecutre slides, but changed dirname in Config.in
- Updated aesd-assignments.mk per lecture 
- no changes to base_external/package/aesd-assignments/Config.in
- Implement finder-test.sh updates described in 4.c of the assignment instructions. Pushed changes from /home/ryan/projects/assignment-1-ryanchallacombe
	Updated the commit hash in the aesd-assignments.mk based on this new commit

- ran ./build.sh and ./save-config.sh
Then can compare file contents of the defconfig vs. the aesd defconfig

J. Ran make menucofig from the buildroot dir. Under external, the aesd-assignments package was there. I selected to add it to the image and saved it to 
/home/ryan/projects/assignment-4-ryanchallacombe/buildroot/.config

K. Run the save-config.sh script in the root folder to save the configuration
Then run $ cat base_external/configs/aesd_qemu_defconfig and see that the line below has been added to the file proving that the package is included in the build.
BR2_PACKAGE_AESD_ASSIGNMENTS=y

L. speedup options:/home/ryan/.dlsh

updated ~/.bashrc with 'export BR2_DL_DIR=${HOME}/.dl'

Verify with:
ryan@Ubuntu22:~$ echo $BR2_DL_DIR

M. Commit changes..........
cd ~/projects/assignment-4-ryanchallacombe/
git add .
git commit -m "initial buildroot configuration completed"
git push origin main

N. Run ./build script

O. create clean.

P. Ran make menucofig from the buildroot dir to add the dropbear package and create the root password as 'root' and saved it to:
/home/ryan/projects/assignment-4-ryanchallacombe/buildroot/.config
Ran the save-config.sh script in the root folder to save the configuration
run $ cat base_external/configs/aesd_qemu_defconfig and see that the lines below have been added to the file

BR2_PACKAGE_DROPBEAR=y
BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_ROOT_PASSWD="root"

Q. Ran clean.sh

R. Ran build.sh

S. Fix some finder-app.sh stuff and rebuild just the aesd-assignments.mk file, then ran from buildroot dir:
make aesd-assignments-rebuild 
then ran ./build.sh again (was very fast)

T. Run qemu
Discovered that we can run just $ finder-test.sh (instead of ./finder-test.sh) because it is in the system's PATH. 
Now I need to go back and edit the script, push to git, update the hash in the aesd-assignments.mk file, run make aesd-assignments-rebuild
the ./build.sh again 




Verification
1. Run finder-test.sh from the root of qemu (see video)

XXXX. SSH into the qemu system
ssh -p 10022 root@localhost
scp -P 10022 root@localhost:/tmp/assignment4-result.txt . 

### Assignment 5 part 2
1. Push start stop daemon script to repo. Update the aesd-assignments.mk file with the commit hash
2. Navigate to /home/ryan/projects/assignment-4-ryanchallacombe/buildroot
3. run `make aesd-assignments-rebuild`
4. Navigate to /home/ryan/projects/assignment-4-ryanchallacombe
5. run `./build.sh`
